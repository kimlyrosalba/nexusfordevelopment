                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>In the realm of climate action, terms like "carbon offsets" and "carbon credits" are frequently used but often misunderstood. These concepts play crucial roles in mitigating carbon emissions and fostering sustainability efforts worldwide. To clarify their meanings and distinctions:</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Carbon Offsets</h2>
                <p>Carbon offsets represent a mechanism through which individuals, businesses, or organizations compensate for their carbon footprint by investing in projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere. These projects could include reforestation initiatives, renewable energy installations, or methane capture from landfills. By purchasing carbon offsets, entities effectively balance out their own emissions by supporting environmental initiatives that mitigate equivalent amounts of carbon dioxide elsewhere.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Carbon Credits</h2>
                <p>On the other hand, carbon credits refer to the units of measurement assigned to quantify the reduction, avoidance, or removal of greenhouse gas emissions achieved by a specific project or activity. These credits are typically issued based on verified emission reductions, following rigorous standards and methodologies established by internationally recognized protocols such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) or voluntary carbon standards such as Gold Standard (GS). Carbon credits are then traded or sold on carbon markets, providing financial incentives for sustainable practices and emission reductions.</p>

                <h2>Key Differences</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> <a href="https://www.nexusfordevelopment.org/">Carbon offsets</a>  are used to neutralize or offset emissions, allowing entities to achieve carbon neutrality by supporting external emission reduction projects. Carbon credits, meanwhile, represent certified reductions achieved through specific projects, offering tangible proof of emissions reductions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Carbon credits undergo rigorous verification processes to ensure the validity and credibility of emission reductions achieved, providing transparency and accountability in carbon markets.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Importance of Understanding</h2>
                <p>Understanding these distinctions is essential for individuals and organisations looking to make informed decisions in their climate mitigation strategies. By investing in carbon offsets and purchasing verified carbon credits, stakeholders can actively contribute to global efforts to combat climate change while supporting sustainable development initiatives worldwide.</p>

                <h2>Nexus for Development</h2>
                <p>Nexus for Development is an international non-profit organisation operating within the voluntary carbon markets since 2009. The goal at Nexus for Development is to ensure global partners, committed to offsetting their emissions, are investing their carbon funds into quality, certified low carbon projects that not only reduce harmful CO2 but also bring maximum social and economic benefits.</p>
                <p>Since 2009, the international team has leveraged millions of dollars for local SMEs and NGOs across Asia, through the sale of quality carbon credits.</p>

                <h3>What Makes Nexus for Development Different?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mission-driven:</strong> Nexus for Development supports climate enterprises that deliver tangible environmental and social benefits. These projects are focused on women and other marginalized communities where climate change is often felt most and where funding can make the biggest difference.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> Nexus for Development has worked on the ground with local project developers since its inception. This gives them unique experience and expertise and allows for transparency, with detailed reporting on how funds are used and project impacts. So, buyers of carbon credits can be sure their money is making a real difference.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not-for-profit:</strong> Nexus for Developmentâ€™s not-for-profit status means that they are not maximizing profit for shareholders from carbon sales. Climate funding is continually reinvested into quality, Gold Standard verified projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Nexus works with a range of international buyers and climate enterprises across Asia. Find out more at <a href="https://www.nexusfordevelopment.org" target="_blank">www.nexusfordevelopment.org</a>.</p>
